S,GeodesicsIntersection,"computes the intersection in the upper half plane of the two geodesics x, y, where x and y are specified by their end points, given as cusps. If the geodesics intersect along a line the empty sequence is returned",2,0,1,82,0,544,1,1,82,0,544,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,524,,0,0,82,,0,0,82,,82,-38,-38,-38,-38,-38
S,ExtendGeodesic,returns a geodesic with end points in R which extends the geodesic given by the first argument,1,0,1,82,0,525,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,524,,0,0,82,,82,-38,-38,-38,-38,-38
